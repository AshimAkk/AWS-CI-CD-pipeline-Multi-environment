AWS-CI-CD-pipeline-Multi-environment

Scenario:


In this project, I will be utilising GitHub and AWS CodeDeploy to automate the deployment process for applications running on EC2 instances in a Dev/Prod environment. Git is used for version control, ensuring code quality and facilitating collaboration through pull requests.


Key Tasks:


Launch an EC2 Instance for the Dev and Prod environment
Create IAM roles
Write a UserData script to deploy an Apache web server
Create a CodePipeline that orchestrates the flow of code through different stages using GitHub as version Control
Merge the Dev branch to the Main branch in GitHub containing an updated version of index.html
